The project shown above uses SQL, ReactJS, Python, and Flask to create an iteractive webapp for those experiencing healthcare discrimination in the LGBTQIA+ community. The webapp is 
called Hospitalverse. The .py files outside of the folders were used to scrape data from the Human Rights Campaign  Healthcare Equality index, the api folder houses the files for flask,
the src folder for ReactJS, and the rest to connect ReactJS and Flask.
